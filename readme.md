# Neural Network Tests
## Part of Hunter's final Calc project

### How it works
Builds off [Synaptic](https://github.com/cazala/synaptic) to create a couple rudimentary Perceptrons in order to model some basic data. For demonstration purposes mostly.

### How to get it working
First
    npm install

Then (after making sure run.sh is executable)
    ./run.sh <SCRIPT>

Where &lt;SCRIPT&gt; is any one of the following
1. xor - easy xor gate network with extra-legible source
2. model - easy to modify modelling network to model any kind of basic data
